# SOLUTION: deploy an Azure OpenAI service in a hub-and-spoke network topology and publish it internally via a private Azure API Management

Azure OpenAI offers a suite of AI models and tools that help in developing applications that can understand and interpret human language. It's recommended to have a single OpenAI instance within an enterprise to streamline operations, reduce redundancy, costs and ensure consistent AI performance across multiple applications.

A common API Manager plays a pivotal role in the enterprise ecosystem. It provides a unified interface for designing, building, managing, and scaling APIs, thereby enhancing the interconnectivity between different applications. The benefits include improved efficiency, better control over data flow, and enhanced security through standardized protocols.

Enterprises are encouraged to use the Hub and Spoke network architecture. This model allows a central 'hub' to connect with multiple 'spokes' or peripheral networks, promoting efficient data transfer and communication. It offers advantages such as reduced latency, better traffic management, and enhanced security, making it an ideal choice for enterprises seeking to optimize their cloud computing capabilities.

**In this solution, I show a configuration where, in a classic hub & spoke context, a client accesses an OpenAI endpoint through an Azure API Manager (APIM). The three elements are deployed in 3 different spokes connected to a hub network.**

Specifically:
* All traffic through the spokes is made possible by an appropriately configured Azure Firewall.
* Azure OpenAI Service is exclusively exposed within a network thanks to an Azure Private Endpoint.
* APIM is configured in virtual network integration `internal mode`, this means that API Management deployment is set up inside a Virtual Network having an **Intranet Facing Endpoint only**.
* Open AI, APIM, and the client are configured on 3 different spokes and all traffic is orchestrated through an Azure Firewall in the HUB.


In this configuration, APIM is a pivotal element of the entire cloud infrastructure, therefore potentially accessible both from on-premise (via VPN/Express route) and from additional spokes in the same network. 

> Similarly, a configuration of this type allows exposing any API available in one of the other spokes or even available on-premise, if the routing allows it.

OpenAI configuration through internal exposure requires the following steps:

* expose the OpenAI service via an Azure Private endpoint
* close public access
* configure the internal DNS to resolve the public name of the API towards the IP of the service's private endpoint
* link the private DNS zone to all networks that need to access this API, in our case `spoke-01`, `spoke-02` (APIM), and `hub-net`.

APIM configuration, on the other hand, is more complex. APIM is a service that is composed of, and interacts with numerous other Azure infrastructure components, so the private deployment exposes us to challenges that we need to solve:

* A **network security group** attached to the APIM subnet is required to explicitly allow inbound connectivity, because the load balancer used internally by API Management is secure by default and rejects all inbound traffic.
* **service endpoints** in the subnet to dependent services such as  Key Vault, Azure Storag, Event Hubs and Azure SQL is also required.
* A Standard SKU **public IPv4** address. The public IP address in this configuration is used only for management operations
* a **Private DNS zone** is also required to resolve internal APIM endpoints

the final architecture is shown in the image below.

## Pre-requisites

In order to apply this solution you have to deploy the `hub-01` and the `any-to-any` routing, so that you have a fully configured hub-and-spoke network with firewall and routing between spokes.

## Solution
We will do the following:

* Deploy and configure an Azure OpenAI service in the `services` subnet of `spoke-01` network.
* Deploy and configure an Azure API Manager (APIM) in the `services` subnet of `spoke-02` network.

### Import OpenAI Rest interface in APIM using its swagger specification

Azure OpenAI provides you with REST API references, that can easily be imported into Azure API Management. In this scenario we will expose via APIM the **completition endpoint**.

* download the swagger specification (`swagger.json`) for the API version you want to expose from [the official AOAI endpoint swagger specifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#completions) i.e. `2022-12-01`
* replace '{endpoint}' string  with your deployed api

```
(Get-Content .\swagger.json).Replace('{endpoint}', 'aoai-01.openai.azure.com') | Set-Content .\swagger.json
```

Go to Azure Portal > API Management Services > `apiman-02` > APIs > create from definition > Open API > upload `swagger.json` file > create

Azure OpenAI is protected using the concept of API keys. An API key is a unique access code that acts as a secure identifier. We will use Azure API Management policies to append an API key to our operations. 

Go to Azure Portal > API Management Services > `apiman-02` > APIs > All Operations > Inbound processing > Policy > Edit and insert the following XML

```
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <set-header name="api-key" exists-action="override">
            <value>{{APPPSVC-KEY}}</value>
        </set-header>
    </inbound>
    <backend>
        <forward-request />
    </backend>
    <outbound />
    <on-error />
</policies>
```

For security reasons, we want to use Named values in Azure API Management and don’t paste the API key directly into our policy. 

For this go to Azure Portal > API Management Services > `apiman-02` > Named Values > Add

* Name: `APPSVC-KEY`
* Display Name: `APPPSVC-KEY`
* Type: Secret
* Value: `KEY1` (the KEY1 value you taken above from Open AI)
* click [SAVE]

Now disable subscription key required at API level, so that we can easily test the call in our environment.

For this open Azure Portal > API Management Services > `apiman-02` > `Azure OpenAI Service API` > Settings > Subscription: 

* Subscription Required > `NO`
* click [SAVE]

## Test solution
Finally, you are able to test your API call in Azure API Management. 

Connect via bastion/RDP to `spoke-02-vm` and test API call locally.

Open Azure Portal > API Management Services > `apiman-02` > `Azure OpenAI Service API` > Test Tab > Test `Create a completition...`

* deployment-id: `mygpt`
* api-verison: `2022-12-01`
* click [Send]

you should receive an HTTP 200 answer. 

Connect via bastion/ssh to `spoke-03-vm` and type the following:

```
curl https://apiman-02.azure-api.net/deployments/mygpt/completions?api-version=2022-12-01\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
  \"prompt\": \"Once upon a time\",
  \"max_tokens\": 50
}"

```
you should receive a json message coming from Azure Open AI.
